# üîç SQL Energy Usage Analysis Project

This SQL project analyzes U.S. industrial combustion energy data using MySQL. It explores energy consumption patterns across regions, fuel types, industries, and facilities.

## üìÇ Project Contents

- `Energy_Analysis_Project_Clean.sql` ‚Äì A clean SQL script answering 5 practical questions using aggregate queries, filtering, and grouping.
- Optional CSV outputs and visualizations (if created) can be added for further insights.

## üß† Questions Answered

1. **MMBtu_TOTAL for Ethane & Ethanol**  
   ‚Üí Calculated total energy usage in MMBtu for these two fuel types.

2. **Average GWht_TOTAL for 3M Company Facility**  
   ‚Üí Found average electrical energy usage for all 3M facilities.

3. **Unit Name Trend (1950‚Äì2020) vs GWht_TOTAL**  
   ‚Üí Analyzed energy output over time by unit.

4. **% Share of MMBtu_TOTAL and GWht_TOTAL by MECS_Region**  
   ‚Üí Computed regional energy contribution in percentages.

5. **PRIMARY_NAICS_TITLE vs Facility Name and Fuel Type Stats**  
   ‚Üí Explored energy consumption patterns across industries and facilities.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

- **MySQL Workbench** ‚Äì For writing and running SQL queries
- **CSV Dataset** ‚Äì Public energy dataset (`Project1.csv`)
- **GitHub** ‚Äì For version control and portfolio hosting
